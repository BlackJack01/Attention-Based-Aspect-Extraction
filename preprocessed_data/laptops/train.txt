well worth
ibook great mac money newest powerbook g4 system great mac period
speed fast virtually task o 10 snappy way g3 based system touch
improved radeon mobility video double vram older g4 improves display performance mirroring snappy without lag mirrored display known show
fully support resolution apple cinema display adapter though powerbook vga
performance latest build o dvd player excellent thus far use full screen simulated 16 effect
built networking option include 10 100 1000
ethernet included 90 modem integrated airport card supporting 128 bit wep broken though wep apple also addressed design flaw original g4 series port cover back slit machined better ventilation body flex little le disc alignment seem problem earlier model
airport range improved though still nowhere near good get ibook series antenna quite limited metal case faraday cage anyone
new power adapter big improvement previous quot flying saucer quot design well
chance good never need connect anything built cardbus slot one provided case pin firewire port usb port vga video integrated ethernet modem wireless enough
go figure quibble

powerbook since mid march
day ago realized made switch pc user apple user booted pc first time couple week purpose moving personal file big clunky pc powerbook even going get cool thing look see picture extremely handsome piece hardware
delve right reason buy thing

quickly answer yes microsoft office photoshop file mp3s etc
work perfectly fine transfer
sort thing many peer peer sharing program apple window mac one might even better downside thing none stop anyone thinking checking powerbook buying battery life good advertised plan using extended amount time recharging three hour strongly consider getting extra battery
also rumor since thin dust grease finger get key damage lcd closed happened believe putting piece paper keyboard lcd store solves problem software wise complaint dialup connection painfully slow
